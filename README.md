## 5G-based Link-level Integrated Sensing and Communication Simulator
    Link-level simulator (LLS) to implement NR-based Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) key techniques.
    Focuses on the communication physical (PHY) layer modeling and radar signal processing procedures only.


## Members paticipated in this project:
    D.S. Xue, J.C. Wei, Y.G. Li, T.L. Zeng,
    Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education,
    Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,
    Beijing, PR China.


## MATLAB version and toolboxes required: 
    MATLAB R2022b or above,
    5G Toolbox, Phased Array System Toolbox.


## Main Features
    Link-level scenario generation (full downlink or TDD),
    Communication PHY layer modeling,
    Communication downlink and uplink signal processing,
    Sensing propagation channel modeling,
    Sensing detection and estimation


## Getting Started
    To simulate full downlink ISAC scenario, run 'launchFullDownlinkSimulation' in the root directory,
    To simulate time division duplex (TDD) ISAC scenario,  run 'launchTimeDivisionDuplexSimulation' in the root directory,


## Documentation
    None at present.
